This project is a delivery application developed for a company's customers, employees, and administrators. It allows product sales, registration of new users, order tracking, and user and order management.

- Customer
  The costumers can register themselves 

- Seller

- Administrator

We created a persona that owns a beverage business that was migrating from a spreadsheet system to an application with a database.

The app uses the Mobile-First strategy, with React and Styled-Components for a responsive design that adapts to different screen sizes.
Also, we structured the application with the MSC (Model - Service - Controller) architecture and used MySQL as the database. As for user authentication, we use the JSON Web Token to redirect users according to their registration profile.
